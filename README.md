# Introduction
This is the final work for Basic Programming course (2019 Fall) .  
This project is a LOGO language interpreter, which reads "fake" LOGO language (an educational program language for kids) and executes it by C++.  
The project is constructed by Qt Creator, so we have both Windows and MacOS version.
